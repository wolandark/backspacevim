# Intro

The purpose of this project is to not only provide an IDE-like vimrc, but also to teach you how it is constructed. This project tries to maintain a fairly small `vimrc` and provide a **great out of the box experience** as well serving as a ground for further customization.

# Dependencies

- Vim 9.0 or later with huge features.
  - Note: This config will definitely work with Vim 8.0 and later, but don't miss out on the great features of Vim 9.1! Grab the latest Vim!
- Nodejs
- npm
- Python (For Compiling The Leaderf C Extension)

**Example:** <br>
Debian:<br>
`sudo apt install nodejs npm` <br>
Arch:<br>
`sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`

# Installation

### Method I (Recommended)

After installing the dependencies, clone the repo and run the `symlink.sh` script. Then simply wait for the setup to complete.

**Tl;Dr:**

- Install Dependencies
- Clone This Repo ` git clone https://github.com/wolandark/wim.git`
- cd Into The Cloned Repo `cd wim`
- Run the `symlink.sh` script `./symlink.sh`

This method enables you to update Wim without having to clone the repo again or
run the install script. Simply `git pull` every once in a while and as long as
you don't mess up the symlinks, you won't have to do anything else. **If** you
happen to mess up the symlinks, just run the update.sh script that will be
generated after the first time of running the `symlink.sh` script.

### Method II

After installing the dependencies, run the `install.sh` script. The script is **safe** and works sudo-less.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolandark/wim/master/install.sh)
```

**Tl;Dr:**

- Install Dependencies
- Run the `install.sh` Using Curl

# Some of the features

**See the exhaustive feature list above**

- Out of the box plugin installation <br>
- Out of the box LSP setup for HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Bash and MORE if you want it!
- Tab Completion and snippets for fast coding <br>
- Thoroughly documented in build-it wiki (<leader>vw to access it anytime!)
- Easy tab and split navigation <br>
- Start Screen with bookmarks and file history <br>
- Beautiful catpuccino and base16 colorschemes
- Customized Lighline statusline <br>
- Customizability! It is lightweight and extensible and FAST!

# Notes
- Make sure to setup your $TERM variable properly. On Unix and Unix-like systems the $TERM must report `xterm-256color`.  See [this](https://github.com/wolandark/wim/wiki#how-to-setup-term) wiki note.
- Some terminals hold unto your Ctrl or Alt or shift key for their own functions. It's up to you to use a sane terminal emulator!
- This config has been tested on various GNU+Linux distros as well as MacOS, FreeBSD and Windows, but official support will only be provided for GNU+Linux distros.

<details>
<summary>Notes for Windows users</summary>

Make sure you have `nodejs` and `npm` in your `PATH` and that you have `curl` installed. <br>  
You have to manually install `fzf` from the official repo and remove the `Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }` line from `wim-vim`. (Yes because you're on windows you must suffer!) <br>
Clone the repo and move the `wim-vim` file under `C:\Users\username\vimfiles\vimrc`. Make sure to rename it to `vimrc`. Copy over the `coc-settings.json`, `cheat40.txt` and the whole `vimwiki` directory also under the aforementioned path.

Then simply start Vim and wait for the installation to finish.

<summary>Notes for Mac users</summary>

If you plan to use Vim from the terminal, FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST USE ITERM!

# Usage
Once the installation is finished, launch vim and enter your wiki index by
issuing `<Leader>vw` (leader means space) in normal mode. Then open the Wim
wiki page and read at your own leisure.

You can use Vim as you normally would and gradually learn about the features of Wim's config,
and the plugins it comes with. 

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/wolandark/wim/wiki) which has more information than the integrated wiki and will be updated more regularly. 

Any time you feel lost, remember `:Cheat40` and
`:Maps` are your best friends, after the wiki of course 😉.
